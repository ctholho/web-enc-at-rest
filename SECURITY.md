## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please enter a report on the project's Github issue tracker using the bug template.

Maybe it seems clear to you that existing users of WEaR could be impacted, and I'm not responding to your issue in a reasonable amount of time. In this case, I encourage you to file a vulnerability report with NPM to reduce potential harm.
