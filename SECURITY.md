# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, *NO* versions of the WEaR library are recommended for production use. The package is in a peer review period.

However, all security vulnerability issues will be taken seriously and resolved in some way.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please enter a report on the project's Github issue tracker using the bug template.
https://github.com/erikh2000/web-enc-at-rest/issues

Maybe it seems clear to you that existing users of WEaR could be impacted, and I'm not responding to your issue in a reasonable amount of time. In this case, I encourage you to file a vulnerability report with NPM to reduce potential harm.
