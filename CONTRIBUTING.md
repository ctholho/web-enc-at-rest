### Contributing to This Project

I am interested in working with other people, but not in the typical way that open source projects do. Progress on this library will be slow and cautious, supported by thorough design. There's such a high bar to making changes, that I think it would be frustrating for both myself and contributors to work through PRs. So this project just doesn't seem to be the kind where I should accept PRs from the coding public.

Here are the kinds of contributions I am seeking, if you are gracious enough to offer them:
* Well-considered criticism of the code, particularly if it helps to prevent security vulnerabilities.
* Bug reports.
* Feature requests. (I am very much inclined to keep this core package minimal, but I'm planning add-on packages.)

The above items can all be entered via Github issues for the project.

### Contact Info

Here is my LinkedIn profile. You can use it to message me.

I generally accept connections on LinkedIn from strangers, particularly if we have a shared interest, like Offline-First or encryption-at-rest. Just please don't pitch me on a product or service. And it helps my mental sorting if you mention you have an interest in WEaR.
