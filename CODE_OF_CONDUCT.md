# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

I think I just put this here to make Github's checklist rating happy.

Look, it's pretty simple. I don't have time to deal with people that are a hassle. But I do have time for people that come with well-considered criticism and any constructive communication.

Github must be a pretty boring playground for recreational trolls, so I'm not that worried about them. And I'm not taking pull requests into the project at this time, so that removes a large amount of potential misunderstanding and friction.

Just be nice, and speak like you and I are human beings sitting in the same room together.
