**Readme Check**

Please make sure you've read the README.md - in particular, the goals at the top (secure, lightweight, understandable) and any sections related to upcoming features or anti-goals.

**Propose Your Feature**

Write up a quick description of your feature. I'm open-minded and interested.

If you've got a rant or misgiving, please... take a pause before typing it out to the world. Speak constructively and in good faith. I will listen.
