**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. If it's not real obvious, please call out which result or behavior was unexpected to you. Example: "decrypt() unexpectedly returns null when passed an empty array."

**To Reproduce**
If you have code or instructions that show how to reproduce the bug, I'm much more likely to have success in resolving it.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem that you think would be valuable. Your browser and O/S are often important as WEaR depends on the browser's implementation of Web Crypto.
